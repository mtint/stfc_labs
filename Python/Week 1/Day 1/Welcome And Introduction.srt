Hello! I'm Bill Boyd.

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,465
In this course we'll be learning the basics of Python programming.

3
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:17,545
Python has become one of the most popular programming languages, accepted by business,

4
00:00:17,545 --> 00:00:20,789
and yet very popular in colleges,

5
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,640
and its popularity is rising.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,510
So what makes it so popular?

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,080
Well, for one thing it's so readable.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,845
You feel like you're reading an English description of your program,

9
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:36,145
rather than technical code.

10
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:41,100
Since it is so readable and handles so many low level computing details,

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,240
you can focus on the solution to your problem rather than on the code itself.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,530
It is so readable,

13
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,705
it's quite pretty just to look at the code.

14
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:56,045
Another reason for its popularity is that it is an interpreted language,

15
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:58,240
so that you don't have to go through the stages of

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,375
compiling your program before you can run it.

17
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,875
You simply run the program after you write it.

18
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:08,540
Python is also free,

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,380
just download it from the web and install it.

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,145
There are various websites that offer these downloads,

21
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:20,366
each offering lots of useful Python libraries to simplify your own programming projects.

22
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:25,118
What's special about this course?

23
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:29,345
We use the free Anaconda distribution of Python,

24
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:32,725
although we'll be learning standard Python,

25
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:36,320
this distribution contains features of Py Python and

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,040
improved interface for Python that makes it even more convenient to use.

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,200
It allows us to run and write small sections of code,

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,980
saving us the time and effort of building a whole program.

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,842
This is not only good for learning and pedagogy,

30
00:01:51,842 --> 00:01:56,080
it is convenient when building larger programs.

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,840
We will write many functions in Python and run them while learning the syntax,

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,495
functions that perform tasks that we normally think of programs accomplishing.

33
00:02:05,495 --> 00:02:09,349
Later after we are comfortable with Python,

34
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:14,345
we will learn how to write and run whole standalone programs.

35
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:19,070
When you finish this course you will be a Python programmer,

36
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:24,830
we introduce you to the environment for developing programs into the basics of Python.

37
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:30,000
From there you can expand your knowledge of Python in the field of your own interest.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,580
We specifically focus on learning how to program in Python and leave

39
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,510
complex algorithm development to your individual area of interest,

40
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,915
whether it be physics, environmental science,

41
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:46,990
government, big data or whatever.

42
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:54,130
What is covered? We first learn how to write functions in Python,

43
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,045
moving on to if statements and loops, file and for,

44
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:03,286
to collection data types such as list, tuple, dictionary.

45
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:09,035
Then we learn to read and write text files and CSV files.

46
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:13,000
Think of spreadsheets, we learn to write standalone programs and

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,650
used the formatting capability of Python to make prettier output.

48
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,230
Finally, we put it all together towards a menu

49
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,850
driven database application using CSV files to store our data.

50
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:31,045
In this course we have chosen to use the Python 3 programming language.

51
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:33,200
This is the latest version of Python,

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,295
though Python 2 is still a quite popular language.

53
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:39,555
These two are not quite compatible,

54
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:40,817
but if you know one,

55
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:44,400
it is a simple matter to pick up and use the other.

56
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,985
Grading will be done via automating grading software,

57
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:51,270
so you'll be able to see the grade on one of your submitted programs

58
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,380
within minutes and resubmit often as you like.

59
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,000
The goal here is to ensure that you finish with the skills you need.
